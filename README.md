# Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging financial data and quantitative techniques to construct and analyze optimal investment portfolios. The core objective is to apply principles of modern portfolio theory (MPT) and its derivatives to help hypothetical investors make informed decisions by balancing risk and return.

# Highlights
Data-Driven Portfolio Construction: Utilizes historical stock data to analyze asset performance and correlations.
  - Implements algorithms to identify the efficient frontier, showcasing portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of return.
  - Provides tools and visualizations to understand the trade-offs between risk and return for different asset allocations.
  - Demonstrates the benefits of diversification in reducing portfolio risk.
  - Performance Metrics: Calculates key performance indicators such as Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and Alpha to evaluate portfolio effectiveness.

# Technologies Used
  - Python: the primary programming language for data mining.
  - Pandas: for data manipulation using DataFrames.
  - Alpaca API & Requests Library: for data source for historical bars.
  - LIbreOffice Calc: the primary software for data analysis and algorithm implementation.
     - DEPS Evolutionary Algorithm: the primary algorithm used in optimizing risk-return ratios.
